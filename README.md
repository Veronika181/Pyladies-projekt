Asteroids

A final project I created as part of the Pyladies course. In this course, the main object is a rocket controlled by arrow keys, shooting down asteroids with lasers.
This project still needs improvement, and in the future, I would like to add more effects, a scoring system, etc., and also create an introductory screen for the start of the game.
